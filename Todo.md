<ul>
<li> Stop using notebooks. Move notebooks into some directory so we have a copy. Split code between Dataset creation and training.  
<li> Add option to data preparation: target is either energy, or atomization energy
<li> Split data train and test, write code for testing
<li> Experiment with removing nodes when they do not have features: https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.6.x/generated/dgl.to_simple.html
<li> Add to the code invariance to rotation, translation, etc...
<li> Continue adding more information for wandb
<li> Add another representation for local environments, Coulom matrix (sorted):  https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/tutorials/descriptors/coulomb_matrix.html
